## Background

I want to help others who may be interested in getting into web development. Hopefully through this quiz, they will get intrigued and want to learn more afterwards.

## Challenges

This website was challenging with being able to save the high score, the current score and with being able to manipulate the DOM through JavaScript.

## Learnings

I learned so much more about JavaScript logic, commands, DOM manipulation. I was also able to refresh my knowledge of some basic CSS.


## Usage

Click on the Start Quiz button, read the questions and select the correct answer on each questions to the best of your ability. At the end of the quiz, type in your name or initials and play again.

## Credits

Thank you to Columbia's Full-Stack Web Developer bootcamp for all the assistance and for teaching me all that I have learned.
