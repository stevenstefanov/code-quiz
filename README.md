# code-quiz

## What is the project?

This project is a multiple choice quiz on programming. It involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user is presented with 4 questions, each containing 4 options with 1 correct answer.

## What were the challenges?

This website was challenging with being able to save the high score, the current score and with being able to manipulate the DOM through JavaScript.

## What was updated?

This project was created from scratch so nothing was updated.

## Why did I decide to do this project?

I want to help others who may be interested in getting into web development. Hopefully through this quiz, they will get intrigued and want to learn more afterwards.

## What I learned in the process?

I learned so much more about JavaScript logic, commands, DOM manipulation. I was also able to refresh my knowledge of some basic CSS.

## What makes this project stand out?

This project is a great example of a multiple choice, timed quiz that keeps highscores on the local storage.
